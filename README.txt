Some Javascript exercises from the Javascript book "Eloquent Javascript" (very good 
Javascript book), executed and tested on the nodejs version v4.2.6.

The exercises are grouped by chapter (until the chapter 6 so far), being each folder a 
chapter, and inside the folder, are the exercises from the chapter ( or the majority :D ).

Note: I write the exercises in english only to train my english, there are no more specific
reason.
